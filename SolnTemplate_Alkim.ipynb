    "\n",
    "First, you will load and visualize the data portion we have provided to you and then extract two different set of features to build a classifier on. When you extracted the desired features, you will run your logistic regression implementation with gradient descent on the representations to classify digits into 1 and 5. You will experiment with different learning rates  and regularization parameter ($\\lambda$) and find the optimal $\\lambda$ with 5-fold cross validation. Finally, you will evaluate the implemented models, decide which is the best performing one and visualize a decision boundary.\n",
